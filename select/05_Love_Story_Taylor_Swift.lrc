[00:15.89] We were both young when I first saw you
[00:19.79] I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[00:23.49] I'm standing there
[00:26.56] On a balcony, in summer air
[00:32.06] See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[00:36.13] See you make your way through the crowd
[00:39.54] And say, "Hello"
[00:43.14] Little did I know
[00:51.64] 
[00:47.92] That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
[00:51.97] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[00:55.58] And I was crying on the staircase
[00:58.10] Begging you, "Please don't go"
[01:03.04] And I said
[01:08.04] 
[01:04.40] "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[01:08.67] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[01:12.56] You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
[01:16.87] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[01:35.87] 
[01:24.27] So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[01:28.53] We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
[01:31.80] So close your eyes
[01:34.83] Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[01:56.33] 
[01:40.30] 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
[01:44.22] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[01:47.93] But you were everything to me
[01:50.44] I was begging you, "Please don't go"
[01:55.14] And I said
[02:00.14] 
[01:56.71] "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[02:00.96] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[02:04.88] You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
[02:09.16] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[02:28.16] 
[02:12.99] Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
[02:17.37] This love is difficult, but it's real
[02:21.15] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[02:25.28] It's a love story, baby, just say yes
[02:43.78] 
[02:32.45] Oh, oh-oh
[02:36.95] 
[02:44.12] I got tired of waiting
[02:48.22] Wondering if you were ever coming around
[02:51.88] My faith in you was fading
[02:56.77] When I met you on the outskirts of town
[03:00.04] And I said
[03:05.04] 
[03:01.46] "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
[03:05.55] I keep waiting for you, but you never come
[03:09.24] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
[03:12.90] He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
[03:17.06] And said
[03:21.06] 
[03:17.31] "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
[03:21.57] I love you, and that's all I really know
[03:25.43] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[03:29.88] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[03:48.88] 
[03:36.41] Oh, oh-oh
[03:40.34] Oh, oh-oh, oh
[03:45.52] 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

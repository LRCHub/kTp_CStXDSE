[00:17.44] We were both young when I first saw you
[00:21.38] I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[00:24.84] I'm standing there
[00:27.94] On a balcony, in summer air
[00:33.50] See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[00:37.89] See you make your way through the crowd
[00:41.35] And say, "Hello"
[00:44.34] Little did I know
[00:52.84] 
[00:49.51] That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
[00:53.83] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[00:57.76] And I was crying on the staircase
[00:59.95] Begging you, "Please don't go"
[01:04.55] And I said
[01:09.55] 
[01:06.40] "Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone
[01:09.96] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[01:13.80] You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
[01:18.10] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[01:37.10] 
[01:26.06] So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[01:29.98] We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
[01:33.67] So close your eyes
[01:36.42] Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
[01:57.92] 
[01:41.72] 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
[01:45.67] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[01:49.46] But you were everything to me
[01:52.34] I was begging you, "Please don't go"
[01:57.06] And I said
[02:02.06] 
[01:59.21] "Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[02:02.46] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[02:06.28] You'll be the prince, and I'll be the princess
[02:11.36] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[02:30.36] 
[02:14.65] Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
[02:18.23] This love is difficult, but it's real
[02:22.54] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[02:26.50] It's a love story, baby, just say yes
[02:45.00] 
[02:33.98] Oh, oh-oh
[02:38.48] 
[02:46.04] I got tired of waiting
[02:49.79] Wondering if you were ever coming around
[02:53.53] My faith in you was fading
[02:58.18] When I met you on the outskirts of town
[03:01.81] And I said
[03:06.81] 
[03:03.06] "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
[03:06.95] I keep waiting for you, but you never come
[03:10.86] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
[03:14.92] He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
[03:18.35] And said
[03:22.35] 
[03:19.33] "Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
[03:23.02] I love you, and that's all I really know
[03:27.14] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[03:31.00] It's a love story, baby, just say yes"
[03:50.00] 
[03:38.30] Oh, oh-oh
[03:42.31] Oh, oh-oh, oh
[03:47.22] 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

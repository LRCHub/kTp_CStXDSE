[00:16.33] We were both young when I first saw you
[00:20.16] I close my eyes and the flashback starts
[00:23.63] I'm standin' there
[00:26.96] On a balcony in summer air
[00:32.48] See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
[00:36.53] See you make your way through the crowd
[00:39.78] And say, "Hello"
[00:43.56] Little did I know
[00:48.37] That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
[00:52.12] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[00:55.96] And I was cryin' on the staircase
[00:58.69] Beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said
[01:04.74] Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[01:08.81] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[01:12.85] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[01:16.87] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[01:24.63] So I sneak out to the garden to see you
[01:28.94] We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
[01:32.24] So close your eyes
[01:35.24] Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
[01:40.82] 'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
[01:44.60] And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
[01:48.37] But you were everything to me
[01:50.60] I was beggin' you, "Please don't go," and I said
[01:57.19] Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
[02:01.23] I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
[02:05.26] You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
[02:09.28] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[02:13.32] Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
[02:17.62] This love is difficult, but it's real
[02:21.37] Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
[02:25.43] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[02:32.70] Oh, oh
[02:44.58] I got tired of waiting
[02:48.63] Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
[02:52.35] My faith in you was fading
[02:57.20] When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said
[03:01.68] Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
[03:05.74] I keep waiting for you, but you never come
[03:09.53] Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
[03:13.33] He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
[03:17.12] And said, "Marry me, Juliet
[03:19.65] You'll never have to be alone
[03:21.90] I love you and that's all I really know
[03:25.72] I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
[03:29.96] It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
[03:36.78] Oh, oh, oh
[03:40.80] Oh, oh, oh, oh
[03:45.84] 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you
